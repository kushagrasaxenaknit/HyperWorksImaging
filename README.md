Assignment
I have implemented getting label for image using Microsoft vision Api.<br>
Gps coordinates get captured if user takes pic from app .<br>
user need to enable gps for this <br>
I have given edit text box to change label if user does't find the predicted label correct.<br>
then user can upload pic along with gps coordinated and label . I have implemented this using Firebase.<br>
then user can retrieve image by giving it's name and it's saved to internal storage <br>
user can upload image only after getting label <br>
